# ALU-Verilog-Design

This project implements a **Basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Verilog HDL**.

## Objective
To design and verify an ALU that performs basic arithmetic and logical operations.

## Operations Implemented
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- AND  
- OR  
- NOT  

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL  
- Xilinx Vivado (xsim)

## Files
- `alu.v` – ALU design code  
- `tb_alu.v` – Testbench for verification  
- `simulation/Simulation_Report_ALU.pdf` – Simulation report  
- `simulation/waveforms/` – Simulation waveform screenshots  

## Simulation
The design was verified using behavioral simulation in Vivado.  
Waveforms confirm correct operation for all supported functions.
